# facultyleave
The project titled Leave Management Portal is a leave management software for automating the process of applying for leave and keeping track of leaves taken by the faculty of a particular department. The project is developed in java, which mainly focuses on basic operations like- 
• Filling a leave application/application for encashment/application for maternity/paternity leave. 
• Provision to take an extra class in case of absence of teaching staff taking the same section as that particular faculty who is on leave. 
• A list of all the teachers who have filled the application for leave and authority for the HOD to either accept or reject the application.
